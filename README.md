# Welcome to the TeaMp0isoN Shell v1.0.3

I came across a MSDOS shell somewhere on the internet and thought it was a really cool idea. Sadly I don't remember the original author. As much as I liked the design, I really hated windows, so I decieded to replicate a Linux shell instead. It's nothing special, but it's something I really enjoyed creating. Credits to the original author once again for the original design.
